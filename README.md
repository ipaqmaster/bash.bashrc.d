# About

This is an exerpt of bash functions found in my /etc/bash.bashrc, deployed to all my hosts via Saltstack.

My full file contains some sensitive info so this more of a best effort collection of useful bashisms. Or a showcase of the most useful?
Some made by me, others aggregated over time.
Hopefully somebody finds at least one of them useful ‚ù§

# Usage

If you see something you like source it or append them to your own bashrc
These snippets may be useful but they won't install dependencies automatically.

I've also provided some commented examples in the more complex functions.
