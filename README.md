# About

A break-out of my bash.bashrc functions and tools for modular management. Some made by me, others aggregated over time. Hopefully useful to somebody.

# Usage

If you see something you like source it or append them to your own bashrc
These snippets may be useful but they won't install dependencies automatically.
I've also provided some commented examples in the more complex functions.
